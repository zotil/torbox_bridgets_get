# DESCRIPTION
# This file fetches one new bridge. The return values is:
# obfs4 <IP address>:<Port> <Fingerprint> <Certificate> <iat-mode>
#
# IMPORTANT
# The bridge database delivers only 1-3 bridges approximately every 24 hours,
# of which we pick one. With the bridges already delivered this should be sufficient.
#
# SYNTAX
# ./bridges_get.py

tmp_dir = '/tmp' # where we store the temporal captchas to solve (full path)
tor_get_bridges_url = 'https://bridges.torproject.org/bridges?transport=obfs4' # url where we get the bridges
